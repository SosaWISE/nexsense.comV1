                            No matter what life throws your way, you can be prepared with a Nexsense home security system.  With technology that watches your doors, windows, and smoke detectors, you can feel ready for whatever comes next.

                        <h2>How does Nexsense protect your home?</h2>
                        <p>
                            So how does a home security system work?  With today's technology it's simple.  We install a touchscreen control panel that communicates with our monitoring station keeping you within a tap of help when you need it.
                            Then we install tiny, simple sensors on doors and windows that can tell the control panel when someone's coming or going.  If you're not home and something happens, we'll have your back.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every system is built on these basic components.  You can add cameras, motion sensors, door locks and more to round out your complete security plan.

                        <p>
                            Once your home security system is in place you can create simple rules to automate your home.  For example, you can set the doors to lock and porch lights to turn on at 10pm every night.<!--  Easy peasy lemon squeezy.-->
